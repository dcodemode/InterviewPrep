/**
 *Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.
 *
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "1 + 1"
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
 * Output: 3
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
 * Output: 23
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
 * s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
 * s represents a valid expression.
 * '+' is not used as a unary operation.
 * '-' could be used as a unary operation but it has to be inside parentheses.
 * There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
 * Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
